This program is designed to locate specific motifs in a DNA sequence. 

The program requires two pieces of information to run, the DNA sequence (DNA_seq.txt)
and the motif you are looking for (entered through user input when the program is run). 

The output of the program is the starting base of each time the motif appears 
in the DNA sequence.
