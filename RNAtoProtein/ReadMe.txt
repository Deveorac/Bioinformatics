This program will convert an RNA sequence to an amino acid sequence. 

To use, either change the name of the file in the code to your own RNA sequence file 
(i.e. replace the RNA_sequence_original.txt with your own file name), or copy your own 
RNA sequence into the txt file. 

Running the code will output a string with your amino acid sequence.
